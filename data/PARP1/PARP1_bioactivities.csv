1867,17783261,CHEMBL3888857,"PAR Assay: Studies were performed as follows: 6000 cells/well were seeded in 96 well plates (Perkin Elmer) in MEM/10% FCS and incubated for 24 hs at 37° C., 5% carbon dioxide. Test compounds were then added at the required concentration for 30'. DNA damage was then induced adding hydrogen peroxide at the concentration of 0.1 mM for 15 min. Concentration curves were prepared in MEM/10% FCS from compound stocks in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and final DMSO concentration was 0.002% (v/v). Duplicate wells for each concentration point were prepared with a typical highest compound concentration of 20 μM and serial dilution 1:3. Plates were dried and fixed adding a cold methanol-acetone (70:30) solution for 15 min at RT; fixing solution was aspired and wells were air dried for 5 min and then dehydrated in PBS. Non-specific binding sites were blocked by incubating wells for 30 min in PBS containing 5% (w/v) FBS 0.05% Tween20. Wells were then incubated for 1 h at RT in PBS containing anti PAR mouse monoclonal antibody (Anti-PAR, Mouse mAb 10H, Tulip Cat No 1020) diluted 1:200 in blocking solution. After 3 washes in PBS, wells were incubated in PBS (w/v) 5% FBS 0.05% Tween20 containing 2 μg/mL Cy2-conjugated Goat anti mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech cat. No PA 42002) (Absorption maximum 489 nm, fluorescence maximum 506 nm) and 1 μg/mL DAPI (Absorption maximum 359 nm, fluorescence maximum 461 nm) (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dilactate) (Sigma cat. No D9564), a high sensitivity dye for nucleic acid staining. After washing further 3 times in PBS, cellular PAR immunoreactivity was assessed using the ArrayScan vTi instrument, with a Zeiss 10×0.5 N.A. objective, and applying the Cytotoxicity.V3 algorithm (Cellomics/Thermo Fisher) with a XF100 filter. At least 10 fields, corresponding to at least 900 cells, were read for each well.",B,CHEMBL3910271,=,nM,6.0,CHEMBL3105,Homo sapiens,IC50,nM,6.0
